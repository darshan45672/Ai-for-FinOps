## Code of Conduct

### Our pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors and maintainers pledge to make participation in this project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

### Our standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
- Focusing on what is best for the community
- Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
- Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information, such as physical or electronic addresses, without explicit permission
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

### Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

### Enforcement responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing this Code of Conduct. Maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned with this Code of Conduct, or to temporarily or permanently ban any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

### Reporting guidelines

If you believe someone is violating the Code of Conduct, please report it by one of the following methods:

1. Open a new issue in this repository titled "Code of Conduct report" and include as much detail as you can (time, place, people involved, links, and screenshots if available). If you prefer not to make the report public, mark the issue as confidential in the title and a maintainer will follow up privately.

2. Contact the project maintainers directly via their GitHub profile: https://github.com/darshan45672

When reporting, please include:

- Your name and contact information (optional)
- A description of the incident with relevant dates and times
- The names of any witnesses
- Screenshots, logs, or links (if applicable)

All reports will be handled with discretion to the extent possible. We will follow up with you to let you know we received your report and any next steps.

### Enforcement process

1. For minor issues, maintainers may respond with a warning and guidance on expected behavior.
2. For more serious or repeated violations, maintainers may take actions including temporary or permanent removal from project spaces, banning, or notifying relevant third parties (for example, hosting providers or event organizers).
3. Reports may result in an investigation. During an investigation, maintainers may temporarily restrict access to project resources or communications channels for anyone involved.

Decisions are made at the maintainers' discretion and are final.
